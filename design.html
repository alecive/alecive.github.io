description: "My open source design work."
---

I have spent a good part of my college life doing graphic design for a living.
Although I don't actively do it any more, the following is a list of the open-source projects I did to showcase my skills.
I'm keeping them in this page for many reasons:
i) historical record—after all these years, people are still using them;
ii) I really enjoyed doing them;
iii) they still are a proof of my graphic prowess, which unfortunately right now is only leveraged in my presentations.
