                        <p>The central motivating theme of my research is to develop robot technologies that enable close, natural, and extended cooperation with humans. I envision mixed human-robot ecologies where complex control commands can be instructed through natural language, and robots are able to anticipate people’s needs, provide the best support to them, and even influence their intents and behaviors. My work focuses on the design of human-aware robot control systems that allow robots to <i>embrace</i> the interaction with the human <i>and</i> the external world <i>by design</i>.
                        This will allow for humans and robots to accomplish together what neither of them can do alone.</p>
                        <p>My research bridges the gap between robot control, human-robot interaction, and artificial intelligence. Over the years, I have worked on i) exploring the breadths of how tactile systems can improve perception in the nearby space, ii) implementing state of the art control systems for humanoid robots, and iii) investigating how non-verbal and contextual communication can advance human-robot interaction and intelligent manufacturing.</p>
                        <p>The following is a non comprehensive list of both my published articles (i.e. projects that ended up in a conference proceeding or journal issue), and work that will not be published at all—such as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">yarpdroid</code> project. If you are interested in understanding more about my <em>ongoing</em> (unpublished) projects, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">contact me</a> (or <a href="{% for network in site.social %}{% if network.title == "github-alt" %}{{ network.url }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}" target="_blank">stalk me on GitHub</a>).</p>

                        <p>I have spent a good part of my college life doing graphic design for a living. Although I don't actively do it any more, the following is a list of the open-source projects I did to showcase my skills. I'm keeping them in this page for many reasons: i) historical record—after all these years, people are still using them; ii) I really enjoyed doing them; iii) they still are a proof of my graphic prowess, which unfortunately right now is only leveraged in my presentations. </p>
