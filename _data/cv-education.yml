   description: "I focused on improving the sensorimotor capabilities of the <b>iCub</b> humanoid, by implementing a bio-inspired system able to learn a multisensory representation of the space around the robot's body (or <i>peripersonal space</i>). The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the <i>extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space</i>, in such a way that it implicitly copes with modeling or calibration errors. Finally, this representation is then exploited with a <i>sensory-based guidance of the motor actions</i> performed by the robot. That is, an avoidance and reaching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects."

   description: "I implemented an <b>SVM</b>-based framework able to integrate visual and haptic information, read from the <b>force/torque</b> sensor of the <b>iCub</b> robot. The system proved successful in improving the vision-based detection of a set of objects by means of the haptic exploration of the same objects."

   description: "I used <b>SVM</b>s to train a <b>PUMA</b> robotic arm how to be the goalkeeper in an air hockey game. The robot observed which of the previously experienced puck trajectories scored a point. Based on this, it learned how to prevent such scores by predicting the final outcome of a trajectory from its first 30ms. Its success rate was beyond <b>95%</b>."

   description: "ISICT stands for <i>Institute for Advanced Studies in Information and Communication Technologies</i>. It is a consortium that integrates the courses provided by the University of Genoa with lessons held by industry leaders. The goal is to better prepare students for industry jobs. To this end, I attended a number of additional courses ranging from <i>Marketing</i> to <i>Telecommunications</i> to <i>Aerospace Engineering</i>. I've been also selected for a scholarship, after a thorough examination (only three positions were available among hundreds of candidates)."
