   description: "My research at Yale University focused on task and motion planning for human-robot collaboration. I worked on systems that: i) provide effective support to the human when she needs it the most; ii) learn complex hierarchical representations from single instructions; iii) proactively ask questions and provide contextual information to query and share internal states and intents."

   description: "I worked on implementing a model of peripersonal space on the iCub robot, focusing on: i) <i>rich body representations</i>, and ii) <i>distributed motor control via whole-body awareness</i>. I also worked on optimization-based approaches to inverse kinematics and robot control: my <i>gaze stabilization and control</i> framework formally solved the problem of controlling a binocular head to gaze toward an arbitrary 3D point in space, and concurrently exploiting redundancy to stabilize gaze."
