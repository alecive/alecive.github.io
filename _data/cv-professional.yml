   description: "I am currently focusing on the exploitation of bidirectional communication between the robot and the human in the context of human-robot collaborative tasks. I am working toward the implementation of a more natural and intuitive interaction, in order for it to be more efficient and effective, as well as less demanding for the human partner."

   description: "I continued the work I started during my Ph.D. fellowship at the iCub Facility. Specifically, I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations (in collaboration with CITEC @Bielefeld) ii) distributed motor control via whole-body awareness (partially collaborating with WYSIWYD project partners). Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans."
