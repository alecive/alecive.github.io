   description: Teaching assistant at the 2015 CBMM Summer School, organized by a number of MIT lab groups and affiliates. I focused on tutoring students during their projects with the iCub. A notable achievement has been the integration of Google Glass onto the YARP framework, that has been later used in order to perform head/gaze teleoperation on the iCub.
 - title: Co-organizer of the <i>Development of body representations in humans and robots</i> workshop
   authors: Matej Hoffmann, <b>Alessandro Roncone</b>, Lorenzo Jamone, and Beata Grzyb
   year: 2014
   venue: IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics
   where: Genoa, Italy, October 13-16
   description: Half-day workshop @ICDL-EPIROB 2014 Conference. The goal of the workshop was to <i>explore the possibility of robots developing models inspired by the mechanisms of human body representations</i>. In this way, they can on one hand become new modeling tools for empirical sciences - expanding the domain of computational modeling by anchoring it to the physical environment and a physical body. On the other hand, robot controllers endowed with multimodal whole-body awareness and plasticity typical of humans should give rise to - in robotics unprecedented - autonomy, robustness, and resilience.
