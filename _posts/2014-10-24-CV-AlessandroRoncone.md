## Who am I

#### Robotics, engineering and design in a single package!

## Summary

Alessandro Roncone was born in Genova (GE), Italy, 1987. He received his _Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering_ with the score of **110/110 with honors** at the University of Genova in February 2008. In July 2011 he completed his _Master Degree in NeuroEngineering_ (with the score of **110/110 with honors**) in the same University. He is currently a _Ph.D. fellow at iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, GENOVA, Italy_. The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience in order to implement a model of *Peripersonal Space (PPS)* on the iCub. The PPS is thought to have a crucial role in humans as well as in animals, acting as an interface between the body and the outside world. It is defined as the space immediately surrounding our bodies, within which objects can be reached and manipulated. It is intimately multisensory, and shows high plasticity: it can be dynamically modulated by incoming information, short term or long term experience, and contextual demands.
