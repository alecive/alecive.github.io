   description: "In my thesis, I implemented a system able to leverage on a multisensory-based machine learning system in order to improve the detection and the identification of an object in the robot's workspace. In particular, I implemented an SVM-based system able to integrate between the visual system and the haptic information coming from the F/T sensor of the iCub robot. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection of a set of objects by means of the haptic exploration of the same objects."

   description: "ISICT is an acronym, that stands for <i>Institute of Advanced Studies in Information and Communication Technologies</i>. It is a consortium created in May 2003 that supports the courses provided by the University of Genoa in order to integrate them with a teaching that is the result of close collaboration between universities, companies and agencies. The goal is to  prepare young people for integration into the labor market, and as such I attended a number of additional courses ranging from <i>Marketing</i> to <i>Telecommunications</i> to <i>Aerospace Engineering</i>. I've been also selected for a scolarship, after a thorough examination (only three positions were available)."

## Me at a glance

 * _Robotics Engineer_ with _4 year full-time experience_ with one of the most advanced robots out there, i.e. the [iCub](http://www.icub.org).
 * Research interests: **robotics**, multisensory integration, calibration, kinematics, tactile sensing, machine learning, computer vision, sensor fusion.
 * Some experience with signal processing, optimization (e.g. [IPOPT](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt), a software designed for large-scale nonlinear optimization problems), and control engineering.
 * _C++ developer_, with a fine knowledge of **YARP** and **iCub** software and libraries.
 * Some of my work is available to download at my [GitHub page](http://github.com/alecive/), or in [Robotology](https://github.com/robotology).
 * Long-time Linux user, and active contributor to the Linux FOSS community.
 * Graphic Designer and freelancer in the spare time, with a number of successfull projects and employments.
 * Obsessed by two things: _pixel-perfect graphics_, and _bit-perfect code_.

## Who am I

Work in progress :)

## Summary

Alessandro Roncone was born in Genova (GE), Italy, 1987. He received his _Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering_ with the score of **110/110 with honors** at the University of Genova in February 2008. In July 2011 he completed his _Master Degree in NeuroEngineering_ (with the score of **110/110 with honors**) in the same University. He is currently a _Ph.D. fellow at iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, GENOVA, Italy_. The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience in order to implement a model of **Peripersonal Space (PPS)** on the iCub. The PPS is thought to have a crucial role in humans as well as in animals, acting as an interface between the body and the outside world. It is defined as the space immediately surrounding our bodies, within which objects can be reached and manipulated. It is intimately multisensory, and shows high plasticity: it can be dynamically modulated by incoming information, short term or long term experience, and contextual demands.
