## Me at a glance

 * Robotics Engineer with 4 year full-time experience with one of the most advanced robots out there, i.e. the [iCub](http://www.icub.org)
 * Research interests: multisensory integration, calibration, kinematics, tactile sensing, computer vision applied to robotics, sensor fusion,
 * Some experience with optimization (e.g. [IPOPT](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt), a software designed for large-scale nonlinear optimization problems), and control engineering
 * C++ developer, with a fine knowledge of **YARP** and **iCub** software and libraries.
 * Some of my work is available to download at my [GitHub page](http://github.com/alecive/), or in [Robotology](https://github.com/robotology)
 * Long-time Linux user, and active contributor to the Linux FOSS community
 * Graphic Designer and freelancer in the spare time, with a number of successfull projects and employments
 * Obsessed by two things: _pixel-perfect graphics_, and _bit-perfect code_.

## Who am I

## Summary

Alessandro Roncone was born in Genova (GE), Italy, 1987. He received his _Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering_ with the score of **110/110 with honors** at the University of Genova in February 2008. In July 2011 he completed his _Master Degree in NeuroEngineering_ (with the score of **110/110 with honors**) in the same University. He is currently a _Ph.D. fellow at iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, GENOVA, Italy_. The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience in order to implement a model of *Peripersonal Space (PPS)* on the iCub. The PPS is thought to have a crucial role in humans as well as in animals, acting as an interface between the body and the outside world. It is defined as the space immediately surrounding our bodies, within which objects can be reached and manipulated. It is intimately multisensory, and shows high plasticity: it can be dynamically modulated by incoming information, short term or long term experience, and contextual demands.
