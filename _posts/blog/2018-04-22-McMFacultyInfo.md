## Model Predictive Control

The objective in control is to determine inputs to a system such that the outputs exhibit the desired behavior. In practice the input can not be chosen entirely freely but has to satisfy constraints. Many different control strategies have been developed to solve this problem including control strategies for hybrid systems. In situations where optimal operation is at an extremum of the constraint set or the process is nonlinear one single control strategy can not satisfy all objectives over the entire runtime of the system and it is difficult to handle constraints with some control strategies. To overcome these problems we propose a control algorithm that combines several different control strategies into one controller.

## Hybrid Systems

In engineering mathematics discontinuities appear in many equations. Based on our theory for closed form solutions of differential equations with piecewise coefficients or perturbation, we perform further research on the theoretical and computational aspect of piecewise functions.

## Immersive Simulation

Together with Dr. Shedden and Dr. Watter from Psychology are are investigating the effects of a fully immersive environment (motion simulator) on humans. One goal is to further our understanding about how motion cues are processed and integrated with other information to enhance learning and facilitate transfer of learning outside of the simulator.
