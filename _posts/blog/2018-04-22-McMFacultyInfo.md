# [Ishwar Puri](http://www.ikpuri.com/index.html)

Dr. Puri is best known for his contributions to the sciences of combustion (with applications to fire safety and combustor design), magnetic fluid and particle transport (by providing insights into thermomagnetic convection, dynamic self assembly and magnetic inks for 3D printing), mathematical biology of disease (that explains the cancer stem cell hypothesis and Alzheimer's disease), and nanoscale transport phenomena (that elucidates new insights into heat transfer and soft matter behavior).

# [John Preston](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/people/faculty/john-preston)

The overarching theme of my research group is the application of lasers in the creation, fabrication and analysis of novel materials that are of interest for future devices. A major focus of our current work is the need for better materials and processes for solar cells.

# [Rong Zheng](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~rzheng/)

Rong Zheng's research interests include Cyber Physical Systems, mobile computing and networked systems.

 * Autonomous monitoring of data centre operations (NSERC CRD)
 * Mobile crowdsensing (NSERC SPG)
 * Indoor localization and mapping (NSERC ENGAGE)
 * Wireless network monitoring & security (NSERC CFI)
 * Sequential learning in wireless resource management (NSERC Discovery)

# [Mark Lawford](https://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~lawford/)

My research interests fall under the general headings of Software Engineering and Control of Discrete Event Systems (DES), in particular Software Certification, Formal Methods for Real-Time Systems (synthesis, verification, and model reduction), practical application of formal methods in the software engineering process, computer aided inspection, and supervisory control of modular, nondeterministic and probabilistic DES, and hybrid systems.

# [Ned Nedialkov](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/)

His research is in the general area of scientific computing and mathematical software with emphasis on interval numerical methods for differential equations and numerical methods for differential-algebraic equations. He is the author of the VNODE and VNODE-LP packages for computing rigorous bounds on solutions in initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations, and the DAETS package for solving high-index differential algebraic equations.
