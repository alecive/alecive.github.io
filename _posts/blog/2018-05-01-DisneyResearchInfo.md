* [Language-Based Interactions](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/learning-and-reusing-dialog-for-repeated-interactions-with-a-situated-social-agent/) At Disney Research Pittsburgh, I contributed to an architecture to engage in social chat and task-based language interactions. This work was conducted with both children and adults. It hinged on using Amazon Mechanical Turk as a means of automating dialog graph growth. I used the architecture to explore generalization mechanisms, dialog graph traversal strategies and more. All of this work was conducted under the guidance of Jill Lehman and with the support of a fantastic team of PostDocs and Interns.

# [Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/)

Stephan works in the field of statistical machine learning. His probabilistic algorithms apply to various types of data such as text, images, sound, video, clicks and ratings. His research emphasis is to make Bayesian modeling scalable to large data sets, using variational inference in combination with stochastic optimization and Monte Carlo methods.

The field of probabilistic modeling has seen profound changes in the past few years, driven by advances in stochastic optimization, automatic differentiation, easy-to-use neural network packages, and the availability of large data sets. Building on these advances, modern variational inference and related training paradigms enabled a rich class of generative models that had been computationally intractable in the past. In particular, Bayesian deep learning and representation learning approaches have experienced a revival, which, in turn, had crucial implications for modern computer vision (GANs and VAEs) and natural language processing (word and paragraph embeddings). My research activities have driven these advances. My vision is to build algorithms and new expressive models that integrate the benefits of modern representation learning with interpretable probabilistic priors, and to apply these models in the domains of natural language processing, personalization and recommendation systems, computer vision, the sciences, and media analytics.

 * [Evaluating Social Perception of Human-to-Robot Handovers Using the Robot Social Attributes Scale (RoSAS)](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/evaluating-social-perception-human-robot-handovers-using/) This work explores social perceptions of robots within the domain of human-to-robot handovers.

Dr. Günter Niemeyer is a senior research scientist at Disney Research. His research examines physical human-robotic interactions and interaction dynamics, force sensitivity and feedback, teleoperation with and without communication delays, and haptic interfaces. This involves efforts ranging from realtime motor and robot control to user interface design.

Dr. Niemeyer received his M.S. and Ph.D. from MIT in the areas of adaptive robot control and bilateral teleoperation, introducing the concept of wave variables. He also held a postdoctoral research position at MIT developing surgical robotics. In 1997 he joined Intuitive Surgical Inc., where he helped create the daVinci Minimally Invasive Surgical System. This telerobotic system enables surgeons to perform complex procedures through small (5 to 10mm) incisions using an immersive interface and is in use at hundreds of hospitals worldwide. He joined the Stanford faculty in the Fall of 2001, directing the Telerobotics Lab and teaching dynamics, controls, and telerobotics. In 2009, he joined Willow Garage a member of their research group.  In October 2012, he joined Disney Research.

* [Falling with Style: Sticking the Landing by Controlling Spin during Ballistic Flight](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/controlling-spin-during-ballistic-flight/) In this paper, we examine the sensing and actuation necessary for a mechanism to alter its fall under a high rate of spin.

Morgan Pope was born in a small rural town near the Utah/Idaho border, where he spent most of his time reading books and building with Legos. He attended Harvard University, where he met his wife and discovered that he wanted to be an engineer. As a graduate student at Stanford, he split his time between building small robots that jump, perch, and climb and chasing three small children that also jump, perch, and climb. He defended his thesis at the end of April this year and is excited to join the Disney Research team.
