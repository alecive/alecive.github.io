   description: "<i>Abstract:</i> The new generation of robotic devices will require machines able to adequately perform rich interactions with objects -- and eventually humans -- in their environment. This aspect will prove fundamental in the context of moving robots from the controlled domains typical of a factory environment toward our -- much less structured -- everyday life. To this end, robots need the ability to express some sort of awareness of their body and their surroundings: instead of focusing exclusively on the end-effector as the only part that interacts with the environment, the robotic field needs to move toward a more distributed, decentralized representation of the self and the nearby space. More importantly, albeit a consistently improving technology, robotic systems are equipped with inherently faulty systems characterized by calibration and systematic errors that need to be effectively coped with.
   This thesis deals with the formalization and the development of a system able to let a humanoid robot learn a multisensory representation of the space around its body (or peripersonal space). The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it lets the robot to implicitly cope with modeling or calibration errors. Further, this representation is put under testing with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot: that is, an avoidance and catching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects."

   description: "I implemented a multisensory machine learning system in order to improve the detection and the identification of an object in the iCub robot's workspace. Specifically, I implemented an SVM-based system able to integrate between the visual system and the haptic information coming from the F/T sensor of the iCub robot. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection of a set of objects by means of the haptic exploration of the same objects."

   description: "I implemented a system able to control a PUMA robotic arm and develop a goalkeeper-like behavior in an air hockey setup. The robot was using a supervised learning technique in order to understand which of the puck trajectories he previously experienced was scoring a point. Based on this, it learned the ability to prevent such points by predicting the final outcome of a trajectory given some initial acquisitions. Its success rate was beyond 95%."

He received his _Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering_ with the score of **110/110 with honors** at the "Università degli Studi di Genova" in February 2008. In July 2011 he completed his _Master Degree in NeuroEngineering_ (with the score of **110/110 with honors**) in the same university. In April 2015 he got a Ph.D. in _Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies_ from the "Università degli studi di Genova" and "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia". During his PhD he worked in the Cognitive Humanoids laboratory of the department of "Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences" and the "iCub Facility" in IIT, Genova. The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience in order to implement a model of **Peripersonal Space (PPS)** on the iCub humanoid robot (see below for details on its Ph.D. project). 
He is currently working as a Post Doc at the iCub Facility in IIT.
