   description: "I continued the work I started during my Ph.D. fellowship at the iCub Facility. Specifically, I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations (in collaboration with CITEC @Bielefeld) ii) distributed motor control via whole-body awareness (partially collaborating with WYSIWYD project partners). Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans."

   title: Thesis title `Expanding sensorimotor capabilities of humanoid robots through multisensory integration. A study on the implementation of peripersonal space on the iCub.`
   start: 2012
   end: 2015
   location: Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova IT
   location-link: http://www.iit.it
   description: "I focused on improving the sensorimotor capabilities of the iCub humanoid, by implementing a bio-inspired system able to learn a multisensory representation of the space around the robot’s body (or <i>peripersonal space</i>). The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it implicitly copes with modeling or calibration errors. Finally, this representation is then exploited with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot. That is, an avoidance and catching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects. "

   description: "I developed a multisensory machine learning system in order to improve the detection and the identification of objects in the iCub robot's workspace. Specifically, I implemented an SVM-based system able to integrate between the visual system and the haptic information coming from the F/T sensor of the iCub robot. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection of a set of objects by means of the haptic exploration of the same objects."

The robot used SVMs in order to understand which of the puck trajectories he previously experienced was scoring a point. Based on this, it learned the ability to prevent such points by predicting the final outcome of a trajectory given some initial samples. Its success rate was beyond 95%."

He received his _Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering_ with the score of **110/110 with honors** at the "Università degli Studi di Genova" in February 2008. In July 2011 he completed his _Master Degree in NeuroEngineering_ (with the score of **110/110 with honors**) in the same university. In April 2015 he got a Ph.D. in _Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies_ from the "Università degli studi di Genova" and "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia". During his PhD he worked in the Cognitive Humanoids laboratory of the department of "Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences" and the "iCub Facility" in IIT, Genova. The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience in order to implement a model of **Peripersonal Space (PPS)** on the iCub humanoid robot (see below for details on its Ph.D. project). 
He is currently working as a Post Doc at the iCub Facility in IIT.
