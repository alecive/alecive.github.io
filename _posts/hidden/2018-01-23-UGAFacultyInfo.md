He has given numerous presentations in conferences and invited talks at research institutions and universities.

    Decision making in multiagent settings

    Researchers are investigating the problem of sequential decision making or planning by autonomous agents in uncertain multiagent settings. Multiagent settings are challenging because the physical state and rewards are influenced by the joint actions of all agents. Research predominantly focuses on a recognized framework for sequential decision making in non-cooperative and cooperative multiagent settings that generalizes partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) to multiagent settings, called the interactive POMDP (I-POMDP). Researchers are investigating algorithms for solving I-POMDPs exactly and approximation techniques for scaling the solutions to large problem domains.

	Applications of multiagent decision making

	I-POMDPs and I-DIDs are being applied toward autonomous control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and planning in multi-robot settings. UAV reconnaissance problems are being simulated within the Georgia testbed for autonomous control of vehicles (GaTAC). GaTAC provides a low-cost, scalable and realistic simulation environment for I-POMDP based control of UAVs in theaters populated by ground targets and other hostile UAVs. Researchers are also investigating simultaneous localization and mapping by robots in settings populated by other robots whose actions may alter the environment. This research applies state estimation algorithms developed within the decision making framework. Learn More..

(A) CAD Model based Machine Vision

Summary: My research in CAD Model based Machine Vision has centered around the design and analysis of algorithms for the recognition and localization of three dimensional objects from range and intensity images. I have designed surface matching algorithms [8] and recognition/localization algorithms based on the Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) [7]. I have investigated hypergraph based representation schemes and designed efficient algorithms based on hypergraph monomorphism for three dimensional object recognition and localization [2]. I have investigated means of improving the robustness and accuracy of range image segmentation algorithms by an appropriate combination of edge- and surface based segmentation approaches [6]. I have also explored means by which the various stages of range image understanding viz., segmentation, feature extraction and recognition and localization can be synergistically integrated in a range image understanding system [4,11].
Along more theoretical lines, I have been interested in analyzing the sensitivity of recognition/localization algorithms to errors in segmentation and feature extraction [9]. In particular, I have studied the impact of qualitative feature labeling on the performance of the GHT [5]. Qualitative feature labeling was shown to result in the formulation of a weighted GHT (WGHT) wherein the weights are looked upon as fuzzy membership values for the fuzzy sets defined by the qualitative feature labels [3]. The WGHT was shown both analytically and experimentally to perform better than the GHT [3]. I have also addressed issues concerning knowledge representation and control in CAD model based machine vision systems.  In particular, the modeling of model based machine vision systems as coupled systems (i.e., knowledge based systems in which symbolic and numerical computing are integrated) in an object oriented representation framework was addressed in  [39,40]. I am currently exploring issues concerning the design of hierarchical indexing/hashing structures for CAD model based vision using object models represented as attributed relational hypergraphs.

Dissertation: Supporting Open Science in Big Data Frameworks and Data Science Education

My general research interests include, Big Data, Functional Data Analysis (FDA), Regression, and Clustering with inter-disciplinary applications related to Statistics and Informatics:

Big Data:

Recently, companies are collecting more data more frequently than ever before. The collection and analysis of this data poses critical problems related to the scalability of new and existing algorithms. How and where do you store the data? Can the data be processed in a parallel and/or distributed fashion? What new problems occur when applying big data to existing analytics modeling methodologies? I'm particularly interested in how to adapt existing data analytics algorithms for use with big data.

Functional Data Analysis (FDA):

Functional Data Analysis (FDA) is concerned with the analysis of data in continuous functional data spaces or data mapped into such spaces. When the data is treated as a set of functions, one can take advantage of information about the functions as a whole, including their derivatives. How do FDA techniques compare to non-functional techniques? How can new and existing analytics approaches benefit from FDA? What challenges are imposed with applying FDA to big data? I'm particularly interested in how to adapt existing data analytics methodologies and algorithms for use with FDA.

Regression:

For decades, multiple linear regression modeling has served as a powerful cornerstone for analytics. However, there are still questions of considerable interest in this area. How can algorithms for regression be adapted to accommodate big data and functional data? How does the introduction of functional data in regression-based models affect one's ability to infer things from those models? How do you accommodate different error models when dealing with big and/or functional data? I'm particularly interested in the areas of regression splines (e.g., smoothing splines) and functional regression (i.e., regression models involving functional covariates and functional responses).

Clustering:

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to group similar objects into clusters based on a similarity/distance metric. Once clusters are formed, a domain expert can infer relationships between the objects in each cluster based on the distance metric that was used. How can algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering be adapted to work with functional data? What are the different distance metrics that can be used with functional dataI? I'm particularly interested in the how to adapt new and existing clustering algorithms for use with big data and functional data.

I am the Associate Director of and an Assistant Research Scientist at UGA's Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Before that, I was a Lecturer in UGA's Computer Science Department. I've also been a research fellow at Aston Business School in Birmingham, England, a postdoc at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition and a visiting researcher in the Kno.e.sis Center of Wright State University.

My research is in logic and artificial intelligence, particularly knowledge representation and nonclassical (nonmonotonic and paraconistent) reasoning.

Before computer science and artificial intelligence, I studied philosophy at Tulane University in New Orleans.

The University of Georgia has always viewed Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence as interdisciplinary fields where computer science meets philosophy, psychology, linguistics, engineering and other disciplines. Both fields are devoted to the study of cognition and intelligent systems. Artificial Intelligence is particularly interested in creating computer systems that behave intelligently.

The Institute for Artificial Intelligence is an interdepartmental research and instructional unit within the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Georgia. It offers two degree programs:

In addition, the Institute participates in two combined undergraduate/graduate programs, allowing a student to earn within 5 years either an AB in Cognitive science or a BS in Computer science as well as MS in Artificial Intelligence.

The Institute's strengths include logic programming, expert systems, neural nets, genetic algorithms, natural language processing and computational psycholinguistics. Affiliated with the Institute are over 75 people from over 10 different countries. We pride ourselves on the diversity of our student body and the ability of our programs to allow for the pursuit of personal research interests.
