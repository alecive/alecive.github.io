# Prashant Doshi

Professor of CS, director of THINC lab, founding director of faculty of robotics, member of the Institute for AI

* Ph.D. from the Dept. of Computer Science of the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2005
* M.S. from the MCS Dept. of Drexel University, Philadelphia, in 2001.
* 2009, he also received the Outstanding Faculty Research award from the CS department at UGA
* 2011, he received UGA's Creative Research Medal, which acknowledges exceptional achievements in creativity and research.
* 2009 NSF CAREER award for his research on multiagent decision making.

His research interests lie in decision making and specifically in decision making under uncertainty in multiagent settings; in semantic Web and specifically in ontology alignment and learning; and in services-oriented computing and specifically in composing Web services and adapting the compositions.

## Decision making in multiagent settings

Researchers are investigating the problem of sequential decision making or planning by autonomous agents in uncertain multiagent settings. Multiagent settings are challenging because the physical state and rewards are influenced by the joint actions of all agents. Research predominantly focuses on a recognized framework for sequential decision making in non-cooperative and cooperative multiagent settings that generalizes partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) to multiagent settings, called the interactive POMDP (I-POMDP). Researchers are investigating algorithms for solving I-POMDPs exactly and approximation techniques for scaling the solutions to large problem domains.

Autonomous control of unmanned aerial vehicles planning in multi-robot settings. UAV reconnaissance problems are being simulated within the Georgia testbed for autonomous control of vehicles (GaTAC). GaTAC provides a low-cost, scalable and realistic simulation environment for I-POMDP based control of UAVs in theaters populated by ground targets and other hostile UAVs. Researchers are also investigating simultaneous localization and mapping by robots in settings populated by other robots whose actions may alter the environment. This research applies state estimation algorithms developed within the decision making framework.

# Thomas Mote

Dean of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences

As associate dean of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, Thomas Mote oversees the supplemental instructional budget, which funds graduate teaching and laboratory assistants and non-tenure track faculty involved in instruction. He also oversees matters related to graduate education and serves as the liaison to the Graduate School.

He is the primary liaison with the division of physical and mathematical sciences, which includes the departments of chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, physics and astronomy, and statistics. He is a member of the geography department, where he served as the department head during 2011 to 2016, and the program in atmospheric sciences, where he served as the founding director until 2011. His research interests are in the areas of climate variability and climate change represented in large-scale atmospheric circulation, particularly in the polar regions.

## CAD Model based Machine Vision

Design and analysis of algorithms for the recognition and localization of three dimensional objects from range and intensity images. I have designed surface matching algorithms [8] and recognition/localization algorithms based on the Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) [7]. I have investigated hypergraph based representation schemes and designed efficient algorithms based on hypergraph monomorphism for three dimensional object recognition and localization [2]. I have investigated means of improving the robustness and accuracy of range image segmentation algorithms by an appropriate combination of edge- and surface based segmentation approaches [6].

## Big Data

Recently, companies are collecting more data more frequently than ever before. The collection and analysis of this data poses critical problems related to the scalability of new and existing algorithms. How and where do you store the data? Can the data be processed in a parallel and/or distributed fashion? What new problems occur when applying big data to existing analytics modeling methodologies? I'm particularly interested in how to adapt existing data analytics algorithms for use with big data.

## Functional Data Analysis (FDA)

Functional Data Analysis (FDA) is concerned with the analysis of data in continuous functional data spaces or data mapped into such spaces. When the data is treated as a set of functions, one can take advantage of information about the functions as a whole, including their derivatives. How do FDA techniques compare to non-functional techniques? How can new and existing analytics approaches benefit from FDA? What challenges are imposed with applying FDA to big data? I'm particularly interested in how to adapt existing data analytics methodologies and algorithms for use with FDA.

## Regression

For decades, multiple linear regression modeling has served as a powerful cornerstone for analytics. However, there are still questions of considerable interest in this area. How can algorithms for regression be adapted to accommodate big data and functional data? How does the introduction of functional data in regression-based models affect one's ability to infer things from those models? How do you accommodate different error models when dealing with big and/or functional data? I'm particularly interested in the areas of regression splines (e.g., smoothing splines) and functional regression (i.e., regression models involving functional covariates and functional responses).

## Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to group similar objects into clusters based on a similarity/distance metric. Once clusters are formed, a domain expert can infer relationships between the objects in each cluster based on the distance metric that was used. How can algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering be adapted to work with functional data? What are the different distance metrics that can be used with functional dataI? I'm particularly interested in the how to adapt new and existing clustering algorithms for use with big data and functional data.

# Frederick Maier, Adjunt Professor of CS, Assistant Research Scientist, Ph.D.: University of Georgia

I am the Associate Director of and an Assistant Research Scientist at UGA's Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Before that, I was a Lecturer in UGA's Computer Science Department. I've also been a research fellow at Aston Business School in Birmingham, England, a postdoc at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition and a visiting researcher in the Kno.e.sis Center of Wright State University.

My research is in logic and artificial intelligence, particularly knowledge representation and nonclassical (nonmonotonic and paraconistent) reasoning. I have a PhD in computer science and a master's degree in artificial intelligence, both from UGA. Before computer science and artificial intelligence, I studied philosophy at Tulane University in New Orleans.

The University of Georgia has always viewed Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence as interdisciplinary fields where computer science meets philosophy, psychology, linguistics, engineering and other disciplines. Both fields are devoted to the study of cognition and intelligent systems. Artificial Intelligence is particularly interested in creating computer systems that behave intelligently.

The Institute for Artificial Intelligence is an interdepartmental research and instructional unit within the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Georgia. It offers two degree programs:

In addition, the Institute participates in two combined undergraduate/graduate programs, allowing a student to earn within 5 years either an AB in Cognitive science or a BS in Computer science as well as MS in Artificial Intelligence.

The Institute's strengths include logic programming, expert systems, neural nets, genetic algorithms, natural language processing and computational psycholinguistics. Affiliated with the Institute are over 75 people from over 10 different countries. We pride ourselves on the diversity of our student body and the ability of our programs to allow for the pursuit of personal research interests.
