# Who am I

{% include years_elap.html from="2010" %}
Energetic and resourceful Robotics Engineer with more than {{ yearDiffStr | strip_newlines }} years' research experience and a proven publication track record. Motivated by intellectually challenging projects as well as personal achievements, I pride myself on possessing a very diverse set of skills. I am capable of pursuing individual research aimed at the development of novel technologies, but I particularly love to be part of a team with bright people working toward ambitious ideas. I make robots work, and I hold a deep commitment to doing so while implementing scalable, robust, and elegant code.

 * Research Engineer with extensive background in a number of different fields, from Humanoid and Cognitive Robotics to Human-Robot Interaction.
 * Research interests: robotics, kinematics, computer vision, tactile sensing, calibration, machine learning, sensor fusion, multisensory integration.
 * _C++ developer_, with a deep knowledge of the _YARP_ and _iCub_ software libraries. Growing experience with the _ROS_ middleware and the _Baxter_ robot.
 * Proven ability to manage multiple projects and supervise multiple people while meeting challenging deadlines.
 * Substantial background in applying optimization techniques to real-world robotic applications. Experience with control engineering and signal processing.
 * Obsessed by two things: _pixel-perfect graphics_, and _bit-perfect code_. This website is intended to showcase the former; for the latter, stalk me on [GitHub](http://github.com/alecive/), or take a look at some of the GitHub organizations I belong to: [Robotology](https://github.com/robotology) and [ScazLab](https://github.com/scazlab).
 * Strong presentation/communication skills thanks to experience in giving both technical and non-technical talks to both small and big groups, tailoring to the audience. Presented to major international robotics conferences, as well as several outreach events, ranging from exhibitions and fairs, to live TV shows and various interviews.
 * Confident in writing technical reports as well as scientific papers. Authored and co-authored numerous international peer-reviewed scientific articles and journals. Some experience with research grant writing.

# Summary

Alessandro Roncone received his B.Sc. _summa cum laude_ in Biomedical Engineering in February 2008, and his M.Sc. _summa cum laude_ in NeuroEngineering in July 2011 from the [Università degli Studi di Genova](http://www.unige.it/), Italy.
In April 2015 he completed his Ph.D. in _Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies_ from [Università degli studi di Genova](http://www.unige.it) and [Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](http://www.iit.it), working in the _Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences_ and the _iCub Facility_ departments under the supervision of prof. [Giorgio Metta](http://pasa.lira.dist.unige.it/). The goal of his Ph.D. project was to exploit insights from the neurosciences in order to improve the sensorimotor capabilities of the [iCub](http://www.icub.org) humanoid robot.
He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) in Yale University, under the supervision of prof. [Brian Scassellati (a.k.a. Scaz)](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/). He focuses on human robot collaboration and advanced manufacturing.
