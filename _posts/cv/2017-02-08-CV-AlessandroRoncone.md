Specifically, I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations (in collaboration with CITEC @Bielefeld) ii) distributed motor control via whole-body awareness (partially collaborating with WYSIWYD project partners). Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans."

   start: 2012
   end: 2015
   location: Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genova IT
   location-link: http://www.iit.it
   description: "I focused on improving the sensorimotor capabilities of the iCub humanoid, by implementing a bio-inspired system able to learn a multisensory representation of the space around the robot’s body (or <i>peripersonal space</i>). The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it implicitly copes with modeling or calibration errors. Finally, this representation is then exploited with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot. That is, an avoidance and catching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects. "

Specifically, I implemented an SVM-based system able to integrate between the visual system and the haptic information coming from the F/T sensor of the iCub robot. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection of a set of objects by means of the haptic exploration of the same objects."

Energetic and resourceful Robotics Engineer with more than {{ yearDiffStr | strip_newlines }} years' research experience and a proven publication track record. Motivated by intellectually challenging projects as well as personal achievements, I pride myself on possessing a very diverse set of skills. I am capable of pursuing individual research aimed at the development of novel technologies, but I particularly love to be part of a team with bright people working toward ambitious ideas. I make robots work, and I do so by implementing scalable, robust, and elegant code.

# Summary

Alessandro Roncone received his B.Sc. _summa cum laude_ in Biomedical Engineering in February 2008, and his M.Sc. _summa cum laude_ in NeuroEngineering in July 2011 from the [Università degli Studi di Genova](http://www.unige.it/), Italy.
In April 2015 he completed his Ph.D. in _Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies_ from [Università degli studi di Genova](http://www.unige.it) and [Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](http://www.iit.it), working in the _Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences_ and the _iCub Facility_ departments under the supervision of prof. [Giorgio Metta](http://pasa.lira.dist.unige.it/). The goal of his Ph.D. project was to exploit insights from the neurosciences in order to improve the sensorimotor capabilities of the [iCub](http://www.icub.org) humanoid robot.
He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) in Yale University, under the supervision of prof. [Brian Scassellati (a.k.a. Scaz)](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/). He focuses on human robot collaboration and advanced manufacturing.
