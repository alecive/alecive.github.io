# Who am I

{% include years_elap.html from="2010" %}
**My work bridges the gap between robot planning and human–robot interaction**.
I look at problems that lie at the intersection of these two fields, and I design human-accessible robot control systems that cooperate with and empower people.
My goal is to develop robot technologies that better interface with the external world and humans, and in doing so to lower the barriers to entry for humans to naturally interact with robots.
To me, **the engineering is as important as the science**.
As such, I implement technological advancements through production-quality software that uses modern software engineering workflows (_versioning_, _continuous integration_, _unit testing_, _containerization_).
**I make robots work**{:.color-banner}, and I hold a deep commitment to doing so while implementing scalable, robust, and elegant code.

 * <b>{{ yearDiffInt | strip_newlines }} years'</b> research experience in **Humanoid Robotics**, **Human-Robot Interaction** and **Cognitive Robotics**.
 * Extensive background in kinematics, optimization, robot control, decision making, planning under uncertainty, calibration, tactile sensing, machine learning, 2d and 3d computer vision, IMU processing.
 * Mastery of **C++**, with a deep knowledge of the _ROS_ and _YARP_ middlewares. Daily experience with the _iCub_ humanoid and the _Baxter_ collaborative robot.
 * Proven ability to manage multiple projects and supervise multiple people while meeting challenging deadlines.
 * Strong presentation/communication skills thanks to experience in giving both technical and non-technical talks to both small and big groups, tailoring to the audience. Presented to major international robotics conferences, as well as several outreach events, ranging from exhibitions and fairs, to live TV shows and various interviews.
 * Confident in writing technical reports as well as scientific papers. Authored and co-authored numerous international peer-reviewed scientific articles and journals. Experience with research grant writing.
 * Obsessed by two things: _pixel-perfect graphics_, and _bit-perfect code_. This website is intended to showcase the former; for the latter, stalk me on [GitHub](http://github.com/alecive/), or take a look at some of the GitHub organizations I am part of: [Robotology](https://github.com/robotology) and [ScazLab](https://github.com/scazlab).

# Summary

Alessandro Roncone received his B.Sc. _summa cum laude_ in Biomedical Engineering in February 2008, and his M.Sc. _summa cum laude_ in NeuroEngineering in July 2011 from the [Università degli Studi di Genova](http://www.unige.it/), Italy.
In April 2015 he completed his Ph.D. in _Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies_ from [Università degli studi di Genova](http://www.unige.it) and [Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](http://www.iit.it), working in the _Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences_ and the _iCub Facility_ departments under the supervision of prof. [Giorgio Metta](http://pasa.lira.dist.unige.it/). The goal of his Ph.D. project was to exploit insights from the neurosciences in order to improve the sensorimotor capabilities of the [iCub](http://www.icub.org) humanoid robot.
He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) in Yale University, under the supervision of prof. [Brian Scassellati (a.k.a. Scaz)](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/). He focuses on human robot collaboration and advanced manufacturing.
