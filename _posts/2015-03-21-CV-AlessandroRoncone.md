   description: "<i>Abstract:</i> The new generation of robotic devices will require machines able to adequately perform rich interactions with objects -- and eventually humans -- in their environment. This aspect will prove fundamental in the context of moving robots from the controlled domains typical of a factory environment toward our -- much less structured -- everyday life. To this end, robots need the ability to express some sort of awareness of their body and their surroundings: instead of focusing exclusively on the end-effector as the only part that interacts with the environment, the robotic field needs to move toward a more distributed, decentralized representation of the self and the nearby space. More importantly, albeit a consistently improving technology, robotic systems are equipped with inherently faulty systems characterized by calibration and systematic errors that need to be effectively coped with.
   This thesis deals with the formalization and the development of a system able to let a humanoid robot learn a multisensory representation of the space around its body (or peripersonal space). The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it lets the robot to implicitly cope with modeling or calibration errors. Further, this representation is put under testing with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot: that is, an avoidance and catching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects."

   description: "In my thesis, I implemented a system able to leverage on a multisensory-based machine learning system in order to improve the detection and the identification of an object in the robot's workspace. In particular, I implemented an SVM-based system able to integrate between the visual system and the haptic information coming from the F/T sensor of the iCub robot. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection of a set of objects by means of the haptic exploration of the same objects."

   description: "This work dealt with the implementation of a system able to control a robotic arm and develop a goalkeeper-like behavior in an air hockey setup. The robot was using a supervised learning setup in order to understand which of the puck trajectories he previously experienced was scoring a point, and eventually developed the ability to prevent such points by predicting the final outcome of a trajectory given some initial acquisitions."

It is a consortium created in May 2003 that supports the courses provided by the University of Genoa in order to integrate them with a teaching that is the result of close collaboration between universities, companies and agencies. The goal is to  prepare young people for integration into the labor market, and as such I attended a number of additional courses ranging from <i>Marketing</i> to <i>Telecommunications</i> to <i>Aerospace Engineering</i>. I've been also selected for a scolarship, after a thorough examination (only three positions were available)."

   authors: "Matej Hoffmann, Alessandro Roncone, Lorenzo Jamone, and Beata Grzyb"
   year: 2014
   description: "Half-day workshop @ICDL-EPIROB 2014 Conference. The goal of the workshop has been to <i>explore the possibility of robots developing models inspired by the mechanisms of human body representations</i>. In this way, they can on one hand become new modeling tools for empirical sciences - expanding the domain of computational modeling by anchoring it to the physical environment and a physical body. Consequently, complete sensorimotor loops can be instantiated and not only algorithms but whole behaviors validated. On the other hand, robot controllers endowed with multimodal whole-body awareness and plasticity typical of humans should give rise to - in robotics unprecedented - autonomy, robustness, and resilience."
