**Want do to robotics?**{:.color-banner}
I am looking for graduate students and research assistants to join my lab at University of Colorado Boulder and conduct research in Human-Robot Interaction, Robot Control and Artificial Intelligence. For more information about my research, please [visit my homepage](/).

## Who you are

 * Somebody who likes robotics
 * Somebody dedicated to achieving their graduate and career goals
 * Somebody who works hard without being pushed by me (in return, I will work hard for _your_ success)
 * Somebody with experience in and/or exposure to (depending on level of seniority):
   * C++ and/or Python
   * Git and/or some other versioning system
   * Kinematics, Computer Vision, Robotics, Control, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (in no particular order)
   * Linux (all the robot code runs on Ubuntu)
   * ROS, the Robot Operating System

It is not necessary to have _all_ the skills I listed above, however, experience with at least one of the tools/techniques and a willingness to learn others as needed will allow us to do some cool research!

### If you are a current CU student

If you are a current CU graduate or undergraduate student, please [send me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) and include a description of your background, research interests and CV. â€‹

### If you are a prospective graduate student

If you are a prospective graduate student (PhD or MS), please [apply to the graduate program](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/apply/graduate-admissions)! Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you have any questions.
For Fall 2019, the application submission deadline is **December 15th, 2018**{:.color-banner}.
If you want to know more about the graduate program, please [go here](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/apply/graduate-admissions). Here is an overview of the research performed in the Computer Science Department at CU Boulder:

### If you are looking for postdoctoral positions

First, good choice! Doing a post-doc was my best decision ever.
Second, as I am currently building up my laboratory, I am not explicitly looking for post-docs, but if you _really_ want to work with me, [shoot me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) and we can talk about it!

## Who am I

 * Someone who thinks robotics is cool!!
 * Someone who thinks robotics is cool because:
   1. There are a lot of scientific problems to solve
   2. There is a lot of engineering involved (and the engineering component is a scientific pursuit in its own right)
   3. Both of them are challenging and interesting topics to work on
 * Someone with a couple cool robots waiting for people to use them
 * Someone who loves running, hiking, skiing, beach volley (but is not necessarily good at any of them)
