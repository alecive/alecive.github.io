## Description

*ANewStartBlood* is the first attempt to port ANewStart guidelines in a dark fashion. As its big brother, ANewStartBlood is a complete suite for GNOME. It's designed to work under _Gnome-Shell, Gnome-Fallback and Unity_. For Unity and Gnome-Fallback mode, please read the README file inside the pack. There is also a Conky file to meet the theme overall guidelines.
