## Description

*ANewStart* suite is a slick, clear theme for the GNOME desktop environment. It's designed to work under Gnome-Shell, Gnome-Fallback and Unity. For Unity and Gnome-Fallback mode, please read the README file inside the pack.

This themes comes also with: _AWN Theme, CoverGloobus Theme, Conky files, Firefox Startpage (a modified version of startpage by =Folter-x),Gnome-panel (and AWN) background images_. Unfortunately, from the 1.3 version these themes are not fully supported, since for compatibility reasons with GNOME3 they became quite useless or unusable.

Miscellanea:

  * Icon Theme: [AwOken icons]({% post_url design/2012-09-01-Awoken-icons %}), colored with `99/15/00` color combination (from 2.4 version, the color combination is `3/217/255` since I've moved from CMY to RGB)
  * Wallpapers: [Frozen by TheOats](https://theoats.deviantart.com/art/Frozen-148293611) and [Cold Wallpaper by xhoOp](https://xhoop.deviantart.com/art/Cold-Wallpaper-271689860)
