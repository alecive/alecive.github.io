## Description

Pushed by the need of having a nice, clean and well designed icon for the iCub humanoid robot (to be used in presentations and websites), I have developed a minimal, nice looking icon to be used throughout my projects (and freely available to others). It is a striking departure from the previous [iCub.org logo](http://neurolab.unife.it/omll/logoRC.jpg), whilst maintaining the same friendly and cartoonish appearance.

The icon is freely [available on GitHub](https://github.com/alecive/iCubArtwork/tree/master/iCub-Icon), in both `png` and `svg` format. It was positively welcomed by many people in the iCub Facility, and over the time it has been used in many different projects and websites.
