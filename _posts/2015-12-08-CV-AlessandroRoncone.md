   description: "I continued the work I started during my Ph.D. fellowship at the iCub Facility. Specifically, I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations (in collaboration with CITEC @Bielefeld) ii) distributed motor control via whole-body awareness (partially collaborating with WYSIWYD project partners). Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans."

   location: Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genova IT
   location-link: http://www.iit.it
   description: "I focused on improving the sensorimotor capabilities of the iCub humanoid, by implementing a bio-inspired system able to learn a multisensory representation of the space around the robot’s body (or <i>peripersonal space</i>). The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it implicitly copes with modeling or calibration errors. Finally, this representation is then exploited with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot. That is, an avoidance and catching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects. "

## Summary

Alessandro Roncone was born in Genova (GE), Italy, 1987. He received his BSc in Biomedical Engineering with the score of _110/110 summa cum laude_ at the [Università degli Studi di Genova](http://www.unige.it/) in February 2008. In July 2011 he completed his MSc in NeuroEngineering (with the score of _110/110 summa cum laude_) in the same university. In April 2015 he got a Ph.D. in _Robotics, Cognition and Interaction Technologies_ from the ["Università degli studi di Genova"](http://www.unige.it) and ["Italian Institute of Technology"](http://www.iit.it). During his PhD he worked in the _Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences_ department and the _iCub Facility_ in IIT, Genova, under the supervision of prof. [Giorgio Metta](http://pasa.lira.dist.unige.it/). The goal of his Ph.D. project was to exploit insights from neuroscience in order to implement a model of **Peripersonal Space (PPS)** on the iCub humanoid robot (see below for details on its Ph.D. project). 
He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) in Yale University.
