aboutB: "Alessandro has a 5-year research experience in robotics engineering, working full time with the iCub, one of the most advanced humanoid robots out there. He is mainly working on perception and multisensory integration. His deep knowledge of C++ and the YARP/ICUB software architecture has been mainly used for sensor fusion, computer vision, tactile perception and control. Head over the research section for more information on his work."
blog: "This is a (not so) secret page, and as such you should not be here. In here, I put everything I might find useful for myself. It is not meant to be consulted (nor consumed) by others. You might find it useful, though: look around, there might be some good stuff in there!"
