aboutA: "Personal webpage of Alessandro Roncone, aka alecive (or alecive87 ), robotic engineer and designer. Creator of AwOken and FlatWoken icon sets, many themes for GNOME2 and GNOME3, and more. He works at iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, GENOVA, Italy."
aboutB: "Alessandro Roncone has a 4-year experience in robotics engineering, working full time with the iCub, one of the most advanced humanoid robots out there. He is mainly working on perception and multisensory integration. His deep knowledge of C++, Matlab and the YARP/ICUB software architecture has been mainly used for sensor fusion, computer vision, tactile perception and control. Head over the research section for more information on his work."
research: "Alessandro Roncone was born in Genova (GE), Italy, 1987. He received his Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering with the score of 110/110 with honors at the University of Genova in February 2008. In July 2011 he completed his Master Degree in NeuroEngineering (with the score of 110/110 with honors) in the same University. He is currently a Ph.D. fellow at iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, GENOVA, Italy. The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience in order to implement a model of Peripersonal Space (PPS) on the iCub. The PPS is thought to have a crucial role in humans as well as in animals, acting as an interface between the body and the outside world. It is defined as the space immediately surrounding our bodies, within which objects can be reached and manipulated. It is intimately multisensory, and shows high plasticity: it can be dynamically modulated by incoming information, short term or long term experience, and contextual demands."
